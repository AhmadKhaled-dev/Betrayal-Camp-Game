# introduction
As our graduation project we were to choose any type of developmet project after discussing with all team members we chose to go with creating a game noun of us had any experince in creating games before but we took the challenge 

# Betrayal-Camp-Game
 Betryal Camp was an idea to make an online game where 5-10 players are spawn into an island, some of the players are Traitos and some are inocents, the game will last 10 minutes. 
 how will traitors win the game:
 1. elemenate all inocent players 
 2. the inocents don't finish all of their tasks before time
 how will inocents win the game:
 1. finish all tasks
 2. elemenate all traitors
 the traitors will try to elemenate all inocent players before the Inocent complete the tasks they're assigned to do. In our initail lunch we made 3 main task if all inocent mmembers do they will win the game
